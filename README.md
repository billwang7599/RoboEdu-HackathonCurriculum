## RoboEdu-HackathonCurriculum
Created for RoboEdu hackathon curriculum
### Project 1
Project 1 is essentially a tutorial on how to use PyQt5. It walks through basic
syntax and calling basic widgets. It also has examples on different layouts and
their syntax. The end project is a random number guessing game which should
incorporate everything learned in project 1.

### Project 2
Project 2 mainly focuses on a more refined program/app using the game Wordle.
This project focuses more on OOP (object-oriented-programming) as we needed to
access widgets from outside of local scope. Lastly, this project goes over basic
data storage using JSON files and manipulation using Python.

### Project 3
Project 3 is the final project where it's a hackathon simulation. A mock
hackathon competition. Information is given via the google slides.
